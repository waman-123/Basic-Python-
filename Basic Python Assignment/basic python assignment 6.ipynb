    "\n",
    "An escape character may not have its own meaning, so all escape sequences are of two or more characters.\n",
    "\n",
    " Escape characters are part of the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an escape character's purpose is to start character sequences (so named escape sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed escape character.\n",

    "To encode a syntactic entity, such as device commands or special data, which cannot be directly represented by the alphabet.\n",
    "To represent characters, referred to as character quoting, which cannot be typed in the current context, or would have an undesired interpretation. In this case, an escape sequence is a digraph consisting of an escape character itself and a \"quoted\" character."
